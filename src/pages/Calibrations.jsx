      <p>
        All calibrations at Eppley are performed according to internationally accepted techniques with
        traceability to the proper world standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pyrheliometers (sNIP, NIP) are compared on Eppley's research building roof platform following ISO 9059 and
        Technical Procedure TP04 from The Eppley Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual. Each calibration is traceable
        to the World Radiation Reference (WRR) through comparisons with Eppley's AHF standard self-calibrating cavity
        pyrheliometers that participate in the International Pyrheliometric Comparisons (IPC).
      </p>
      <p>
        Pyranometers (SPP, PSP, 8-48) are compared in Eppley's integrating hemisphere per ISO 9847 and
        Technical Procedure TP01. Results are traceable to the WRR through comparisons with the same AHF cavity
        standards referenced above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pyrgeometers (PIR) are compared in Eppley's Blackbody Calibration System under Technical Procedure TP05 and
        are traceable to the International Practical Temperature Scale (IPTS) as well as the World Infrared Standard
        Group (WISG).
      </p>
      <p>
        Total Ultraviolet Radiometers (TUVR) are compared on the research roof platform under Technical Procedure
        TP03 and are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
      </p>
      <p>Eppley recommends a minimum calibration cycle of five years and encourages annual calibrations for the highest accuracy.</p>
