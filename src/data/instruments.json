This makes the SPP the ideal instrument for high quality network measurements and as a transfer standard for calibration of other pyranometers. A thermistor is included for measuring instrument temperature.</p>\n<p>*Uncertainty:<br/>\nRecently, there has been much discussion on “uncertainty” and how it pertains to solar measurements. The RSS of the 9060 Secondary Standard specifications results in an uncertainty of approximately 3.5%. The typical uncertainty of Eppley’s factory calibrations are less than 1%. The stated uncertainty of the WRR is 0.4%. Evidence from comparisons of SPP measurements to component sum derived values (using an AHF and 8-48) show the SPP is capable of hourly averages better than 2% and daily averages better than 1%.</p>",

    "shortDescription": "Snow, rain, dew, dirt, dust, salt, etc. can buildup on hemispheres of the Pyranometers and Pyrgeometers and can affect the measurements. Therefore, instruments that cannot be inspected and cleaned regularly may wish to include a Ventilator to blow a steady stream of air over the hemispheres to reduce this buildup. This is particularly true in remote stations where maintenance is rarely performed. In fact, researchers in Arctic/Antarctic regions have even implemented heaters to help reduce ice and grime buildup. A “muffin” fan in the base continuously blows air over both the instrument case and the instrument dome. The clear plastic upper housing allows the instrument, connector, and desiccator window to be easily viewed. A white enameled guard disk, leveling screws and hold down holes are provided. The 8 inch diameter, 5.75 inch high ventilator weighs 5.5 pounds.",

Recent research has shown that the VEN will increase the nighttime offset of the Pyranometers as the instrument case will be warmed by the fan. Many researchers have decided to use a 12 VDC (high flow) fan to reduce this offset.</p>",
